# Zomato Restaurant Analysis

## 📊 Project Description

This Tableau project analyzes restaurant and sales data from Zomato with the goal of uncovering the key drivers behind restaurant performance and providing actionable insights for business growth. The analysis focuses on:

- **Which restaurants drive the most revenue and why?**
- **What traits (e.g., cuisine, location) correlate with high performance?**
- **How do ratings influence order volume and consumer behavior?**
- **Are there geographic or cuisine-based trends among top performers?**

Through interactive dashboards and visual exploration, the project identifies high-performing restaurants, evaluates the impact of location and cuisine on sales, and assesses how ratings and review volume shape consumer trust and spending. The insights are intended to inform marketing, investment, and operational strategies for food businesses on the platform.

#### 📈 Tools Used
- Tableau (for visualization and dashboard development)
- Zomato Dataset (restaurant-level sales and rating data)

## 🔍 Analysis

#### 1. Top Cities by Sales
- **Tirupati** emerges as the leader in total revenue.
- Strong performance is also observed in parts of **Bangalore**, **Pune**, and **Raipur**.
- Cities like **Delhi** and **Ahmedabad** feature multiple high-revenue localities.

#### 2. Top Cuisines
- **North Indian** and **Chinese** cuisines (individually and combined) are the top revenue generators.
- Other high-demand categories include **Bakery**, **Pizza**, **Beverages**, and **Desserts**.

#### 3. Sales by Rating
- Restaurants with ratings between **3.8 and 4.2** generate the highest revenue.
- Surprisingly, **very high ratings** (>4.5) do not always equate to more sales.
- **Low-rated restaurants** (<3.0) consistently show low sales performance.

#### 4. Sales vs. Rating Count
- A **positive correlation** exists between the number of ratings and total sales.
- **Domino’s Pizza** stands out as a leader in both rating volume and sales.
- A few **smaller or niche restaurants** outperform expectations despite fewer ratings.

## ✅ Conclusions

- Sales concentration is not evenly distributed—certain cities and neighborhoods dominate.
- Cuisine type is a major driver of customer behavior, with predictable and comfort-based categories leading.
- Ratings influence sales, but **volume of ratings** (credibility and social proof) plays a more critical role than just high scores.
- **Mid-tier rated restaurants** (3.8–4.2) offer a sweet spot for profitability.

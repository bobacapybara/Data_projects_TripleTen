# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 |Analyzing the Manhattan Airbnb Market| The goal of this project was to help a client understand which neighborhoods and property types (based on number of bedrooms) are most attractive and profitable for vacation rentals in Manhattan, using real Airbnb data. |
| 2 | E-commerce User Funnel & Retention Analysis | A Google Sheets project simulating an analyst's role at an e-commerce company. Transformed raw user activity logs into actionable insights, including a user conversion funnel and cohort-based retention rates. Designed for executive readability and business decision-making. |
| 3 | Saving Superstore: A Data Visualization Project | This project simulates a real consulting scenario where I was hired to help a retail superstore avoid bankruptcy. Using data visualization techniques, I analyzed key metrics such as profit centers, loss-making products, advertising opportunities, and return patterns to make strategic business recommendations. All visualizations were created in Tableau / Excel and supported by business-focused analysis.|
| 4 | Shopify App Success Analysis | This project involved building a multi-page Power BI report to analyze apps in the Shopify App Store and uncover what factors contribute to an appâ€™s success. I used a relational dataset (apps, categories, and reviews) to create interactive visualizations, calculated metrics with DAX, and built a clean data model.|
| 5 | [Instacart](https://github.com/zarina-perez/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/02-EDA_project) | The project task was to help a chain of fitness clubs develop a customer retention strategy. |

# NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Description

This project analyzes Airbnb data in Manhattan to guide a client on where to invest in vacation rental properties. The goal is to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes, estimate potential revenue, and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis answers key questions:
- **Which neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?**
- **How much money did these listings generate?**
- **Are there different preferences for property sizes across neighborhoods?**
- **Which listings and areas are most promising for investment?**

The work was done in a spreadsheet tool using data cleaning, pivot tables, and revenue calculations. Data cleaning steps were documented in a separate log.

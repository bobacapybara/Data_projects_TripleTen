Built a three-stage conversion funnel, prepared cohort-based retention tracking, and applied spreadsheet functions such as VLOOKUP, TEXT, and DATEDIF to monitor user behavior and retention over time. |
| 3 | Saving Superstore: A Data Visualization Project | Developed a series of interactive dashboards to help a struggling retail superstore improve profitability and avoid bankruptcy. Used Tableau and Excel to visualize performance across product lines, identify high- and low-performing subcategories, evaluate advertising opportunities by state and season, and analyze product return trends. Delivered strategic recommendations through compelling and data-driven visuals.|
| 4 | Shopify App Success Analysis (Power BI)| Built a multi-page Power BI report to analyze public data from the Shopify App Store and uncover key factors contributing to app success.
